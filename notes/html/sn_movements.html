<h1>Summary notes on social movements</h1>

<h2>Integrative approaches and frameworks</h2>

<h3>Sidney Tarrow. 1998. Intro and Ch.1 in <em>Power in Movement</em>.</h3>

<p>Tarrow is articulating here a theoretical framework for studying contentious politics. He is squarely working in the tradition of the political process model, using much of the text to talk about political opportunity structures. Biggest claim is that "changes in political opportunities and constraints create the most important incentives for initiating new phases of contention." They then strategically use different repertoires of collective action, and create new opportunities, which are used by others in widening cycles of contention. They use cultural symbols and build on and construct dense social networks and connective structures.</p>

<h3>Doug McAdam, Sidney Tarrow, Charles Tilly. 2001. <em>Dynamics of Contention</em>.</h3>

<p>McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly attempt to set the agenda for social movement research in this book. They want to take different forms of contention, including social movements, revolutions, and riots, and show how they result from similar mechanisms and processes. They critique the existing models and frameworks of social movement theory -- political process model, resource mobilization -- as being too static, focused narrowly on political opportunities, mobilizing structures, collective action frames, and repertoires of contention. They suggest instead identifying three parts in the process: (1) episodes of contention -- continuous streams of contention including collective claims-making that bears on other parties' interests; (2) processes -- regular sequences of mechanisms that produce similar transformations of those elements; and (3) mechanisms -- a delimited class of events that alter relations among specified sets of elements in identical or closely similar ways or a variety of situations. Mechanisms can be of a environmental, cognitive, or relational sort. Mechanisms and processes are the workhorses of explanation.</p>

<h2>Political process model</h2>

<h3>Meyer, David S. 2004. "Protest and political opportunities." <em>ARS</em> 30.</h3>

<p>Meyer attempts to review literature on PPM. Says that it is foremost a study of context, moving the study of "why" of social movements to "how". But there are many concepts of political opportunity which have led critics to suggest that it may try to incorporate all aspects of the SM environment. Tilly suggests that there may be a curvilinear relationship between opportunities and protest. PPM scholars have only focused on one side of the curve. There's not a lot of study of PPM against competing hypotheses. Political opportunities are just added to the model, they are not refined or falsified. Going forward, need to look at the other side of Tilly's curvilinear relationship, focus on a more processual understanding of political opportunities, and allow an analysis of mechanisms of influence, wherein political comes into the mix.</p>

<h3>McAdam, Doug. 1982. <em>Political Process and the Development of the Black Insurgency: 1930-1970</em></h3>

<p>McAdam is problematizing resource mobilization (RM) by developing the political process model (PPM). His criticism is that anything can be a resource here. A resource is anything that enhances the success of action. McAdam questions the significance and impact of outside political support for deprived groups. He conceptualizes the idea of support as a relationship and an exchange. He also puts ideology at the center of the analysis, <em>pace</em> RM theorists. he conceptualizes this as "cognitive liberation", the process in which individuals realize their situation is unjust and believe that it is subject to change through group action. The whole PPM can be conceptualized as a large-scape process leading to cognitive liberation - a large-scale structure process which affects the structure of power in society and the amount of indigenous resources contributes to cognitive liberation.</p>

<p>Criticisms of this perspective -- anything can be an opportunity, just like anything can be a resource. How does the model hold up in different contexts? Is this a causal model? What is the status of events in this model? What are its scope conditions (Goldstone 1998; Ermakoff 2010)? What will it be able to explain? What are its limits? Finally, this is more like a framework rather than a model, as Kriesti (2004) suggests.</p>

<h3>Goodwin, Jeff, and James M. Jasper. 1999. "Caught in a Winding, Snarling Vine: The Structural Bias of Political Process Theory." <em>Sociological Forum</em> 14:27-54.</h3>

<p>Goodwin and Jasper criticize political process theory (PPT) on a number of accounts. They suggest that the political opportunity thesis and the PPM are either tautological or simply wrong. They suggest that these strands overly focus on structure, and that the definition of political opportunity is so broad that it makes the theory tautological -- political opportunity is simply the chance for people to get together. The overly structural focus also ignores culture, only focusing on movements that challenge the state, not cultural movements. There's also no consensus on the causal mechanisms which connect political opportunity variables to mobilization.  Their criticism on the political process model (PPM) is that it still sees things as structural. Also makes them pre-existing and not emergent as part of mobilization. The tendency is also to reify culture and to focus on a particular type of social action, namely, frame alignment. Culture is seen as conscious and strategic, while culture comes in many forms and is not always intentional or instrumental. Their suggestions are to abandon invariant models, avoid conceptual stretching, recognize cultural and strategic processes define and create the factors usually presented as "structural" and distinguish between different types of political opportuniies.</p>

<h3>Kriesi, Hanspeter. 2004. "Political Context and Opportunities." in <em>BCSM</em>.</h3>

<p>The basic point of Kriesi's piece is to disentangle bits of the PPM. PPM is a framework, not a model. Frameworks provide heuristic functions but do not explain or predict. Political opportunity structures are the hard core of the model. They influence the choice of protest strategies and the impact of social movements on their environment. Configurations of actors are the second element - who are the protagonists, antagonists, and bystanders? Last is the interaction contexts, and this is the level which links structures and configuration to agency and action.</p>

<h2>Resource mobilization</h2>

<h3>McCarthy, John and Mayer Zald. 1973. "The Trend of Social Movements in America: Professionalization and Resource Mobilization."</h3>

<p>McCarthy and Zald are here arguing against the classical view of social movements that sees grievances as central. But instead, there are structural conditions that facilitate the expression of those grievances. The first part of this piece attempts to understand the growth of social movement organizations in the 1960s. Why did this come into being? It's not clear if the "modernization" thesis plays out -- with more GDP per capita people should be protesting less, right? One argument against this is that people have more discretionary time to protest -- students, professionals, "transitory teams". But in the 1960s there is also the possibility that there is a class of individuals who are professional social movement activities. SMs are supported by organizations, which are supported by funding from external groups, including foundations and governments. Full-time support means there's an institutionalization of dissent. New SMOs are characterized by a leadership that devotes full time to the movement, a small or nonexistent membership basis, attempts to influence policy, and a definition of grievance that grows to meet funds and support personnel (they take on new demands to survive).</p>

<h3>McCarthy, John and Mayer Zald. 1977. "Resource Mobilization and Social Movements: A Partial Theory." <em>AJS</em> 82(6).</h3>

<p>McCarthy and Zald continue the criticism of the deprivation and grievance perspective. They find that there's not a good relationship between the two. They instead focus on selective incentives, cost-reducing mechanisms and structures, and career benefits that lead to collective action. They focus on aggregation of resources (in terms of money and labor), organizations, involvement of individuals outside of the organizations, the supply and demand of organizational resources, and the costs and rewards in explaining individual and organization involvement. Changes from the original model -- the base of SMOs may be individuals who are not aggrieved themselves. They adopt a number of  strategic tasks, and society provides the infrastructure on which SMOs build. Furthermore, they define social movement organizations (SMOs) as fitting with a larger social movement industry (SMI) in which SMOs compete for individual actors, all of which fit into a social movement sector (SMS). Much of the focus here is internal.</p>

<h3>Morris, Aldon. 1986. <em>Origins of the Civil Rights Movement: Black Communities Organizing for Change</em></h3>

<p>Aldon Morris, building on the RM perspective, wants to explain the rise of the civil rights movement in such a way that focuses on their indigenous resources. He discusses the dynamics of organizations such as SNCC and the SCLC, the individuals within it and the resources they provided as leadership, and, most centrally, the importance of the black church as a basis of support. He includes a lot into the mix of what can be considered a resource -- leadership, organizations, networks, etc.</p>

<h2>Framing, Media, Public Discourse</h2>

<h3>Snow, David A., et al. 1986. "Frame alignment processes, micromobilization, and movement participation." <em>ASR</em> 51(4).</h3>

<p>Snow and his colleagues attempt to understand how movements are impacted by ideology and culture. They use Goffman's concept of frames -- "schemata of interpretation" that enable individuals "to locate, perceive, identify, and labor" occurrences within their life space and the world at large. Through frame alignment processes, movements have an opportunity to shape the process of involvement, thus creating meaning structures for oneself and for others. They identifying four processes of alignment: frame bridging (soliciting involvement), amplification (amplifying constitutive belief and values); extension (extending the frame of normative references to make the movement appealing to others); and transformation (changing one's beliefs or values). The locus of action is different in the last one -- moves it from the movement actor to the prospective movement actor. Each process can be expected of a different type of group -- bridging can be expected from groups with a high level of organization, amplification can be expected from groups in reaction, and extension can be expected from radical groups.</p>

<h3>Snow, David A. and Robert Benford. 1988. "Ideology frame resonance and participant mobilization." <em>International Social Movement Research</em>.</h3>

<p>Snow and Benford extend the analysis from the 1986 article by breaking down frames into subcategories: diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational. You cannot assume that merely by diagnosing the problem that this will motivate people. The framework that must be identifying: consistency of frames themselves -- how do they relate to each other? Belief centrality -- the resonance with the broader belief systems of potential constituents; Experiential credibility -- how much does the frame accord with personal experiences; cycles of mobilization -- the impact of the frame depends on when it is used during the mobilization cycle.</p>

<h3>Benford, Robert. 1997.  "An Insider's Critique of the Social Movement Framing Perspective." <em>Sociological Inquiry</em> 67(4).</h3>

<p>Nearly 10 years after the publication of the seminal article, Benford attempts to critique the framing perspective on a number of accounts. He sees that studies do not focus enough on systematic empirical studies (too much focus on specific cases), have a descriptive bias (doing more to identify and elicit particular frames instead of use them for explanation), do not track frame development (treating frames as "things" rather than processes); reification (seeing frames as 'things' and not subject to collective interpretation and social construction); reductionism (seeing frames as purely cognitive and not social phenomena); elite bias (focusing on the framings of movement elites while ignoring the framings of rank-and-file members, participants, and bystanders); and monolithic tendencies (treating frames as monolithic and not multiplex in nature).</p>

<h3>Steinberg, Marc. 1998. "Tilting the Frame: Considerations on Collective Action Framing from a Discursive Turn." TS 27(6).</h3>

<p>Steinberg argues that given the focus on meaning in frame analysis, it is surprising that there is not mention of discourse. This highlights some key problems within the internal logic of frame analysis and more generally its capacity to analyze the contentious process of meaning production. He criticizes the frame analysis perspective on a number of accounts: what is the relation of ideology and frames, i.e. where do they come from in terms of other culture; the tendency to reify frames; the relation of micromobilization and macro structures remains ambiguous; frames remain internally coherent and stable, but this is not the case; and frames cannot be thought of as a resource, highlighting tension between rational choice and constructionist views of discourse. He suggests instead the need to think of instead of "discursive fields" -- like collective action repertoires, discursive repertoires develop interactionally with opponents and targets. Consensus mobilization thus becomes not a process of frame alignment, but an action-specific process of demonstrating the saliency of a discursive repertoire in defining a problem.</p>

<h3>Oliver, Pamela and Hank Johnston. 2000. "What a good idea! Ideologies and Frames in social movement research." <em>Mobilization</em> 4(1).</h3>

<p>Oliver and Johnston contend that frames and ideology are being mixed up in the literature, and that frames are used uncritically as a synonym for ideology. Need to address the term ideology, which has its roots in social constructionism, and focuses on ideas, their systematic relations to each other, and on their implications for social and political action based on value commitments. </p>

<h2>Media and diffusion</h2>

<h3>Lohmann, Susanne. 1994. "The Dynamics of Informational Cascades: The Monday Demonstrations in Leipzig, East Germany, 1989-91." <em>World Politics</em> 47(1).</h3>

<p>Lohmann suggests that the signaling cues from West German television produced an "information cascade" that resulted in the mass protests in the East. The fact that individuals were protesting against the shutting down of train tracks for individuals attempting to travel triggered a wave of protests country-wide.</p>

<h3>Holger Lutz Kern. 2011. "Foreign Media and Protest Diffusion in Authoritarian Regimes: The Case of the 1989 East German Revolution." <em>Comparative Political Studies</em> 44(9).</h3>

<p>Kern suggests that those with access to West German TV (WGTV) did not have more of a proclivity to protest, nor did they protest to any greater degree. He does this by conducting a natural experiment which compares several counties in East German to each other, the treatment group which received WGTV and the control group which did not. In contrast to the discussions of Kuran and Lohmann, which do not transmit information about the size of the opposition.</p>

<h3>Daniel J. Myers. 2000. "The Diffusion of Collective Violence: Infectiousness, Susceptibility, and Mass Media Networks" <em>AJS</em> 106 (1).</h3>

<p>Myers focuses on the diffusion of black riots during the 60s. He suggests that diffusion of protests demonstrate how communication networks spread information on protests. The media transmit information through television -- if they are within range of each other they affect each other. There is an asymmetrical network in which small cities without television are able to be infected but cannot infect others.</p>

<h3>Andrews, Kenneth T. and Michael Biggs. 2006. "The Dynamics of Protest Diffusion: Movement Organizations, Social Networks, and News Media in the 1960 Sit-Ins." <em>ASR</em>.</h3>

<p>Similar argument to Myers, although the argument suggests that sit-ins spread through the South based on movement organizations elites and mass media, namely newspapers.</p>

<h2>Internet and social media</h2>

<h3>Flanagin, Andrew J., et al. 2006. "Modeling the Structure of Collective Action." Communication Monographs 73(1).</h3>

<p>This basically, with Shirky, just says that the Internet focuses our attention on the process of organizing rather than organizations. It doesn't particularly engage with the social movement literature.</p>

<h3>Earl, Jennifer, et al. 2010. "Changing the world one webpage at a time: conceptualizing and explaining Internet activism". <em>Mobilization</em> 15(4).</h3>

<p>Earl and her collaborators construct a four-fold typology to distinguish between broad types of activism. Along one dimension is how much studies believe that Internet activism changes social movement models. At one end are the studies that believe that there is no difference, and that you need strong ties to mobilize. The other end says the Internet changes action in dramatic ways. In the middle are those who believe that it has just changed the scale of collective action, being able to gather more people in quicker ways. The other dimension talks about the operation of Internet. As a continuum, this goes from "brochure-ware" (information distribution); online facilitation of offline activism (providing information on, logistic support for, and/or recruitment for offline protest events); online participation (providing actual venues for participation while online); and online organizing (entire campaigns as organized online). Online facilitation of offline activism tends to be overstudied.</p>

<h3>Earl, Jennfer and Katrina Kimport. 2012. <em>Digitally Enabled Social Change</em></h3>

<p>The key thing that Earl and Kimport stress here is how Internet can be used for the concept of affordances, and how that can be a basis of how to classify activity online. The type of mobilization that grants the highest level of affordances is the e-movement, which is based entirely online. The second is the e-tactic, in which some tactics take place in the online space. The last is the e-mobilization, in which online action works in service of offline mobilization.</p>

<h2>Theory of collective action</h2>

<h3>Olson, Mancur. 1965. <em>The Logic of Collective Action</em>.</h3>

<p>The importance of Olson is to highlight the free rider problem (how it is in one's best interest to free ride and let others pay for the cost of the good) and the efficacy problem (selfless contribution to the collective good will not have any different in the good's attainment). He highlights the effect of size -- it's easier to identify and sanction free riders in a smaller group, and the impact of defection is more noticeable and concrete in a smaller group. The two theoretical solutions to collective action are therefore coercion or selective incentives. This work is so referential because it problematizes the intuitive understanding of groups, which is what functionalist theories of collective action had been predicated upon.</p>

<h3>Oliver, Pamela and Gerald Marwell. 1993. <em>The Critical Mass in Collective Action: Toward a Micro-Social Theory</em>.</h3>

<p>Oliver and Marwell critique Olson because people have mobilized in large groups and have done so without selective incentives. They problematize the assumption of individualism in Olson, focusing on payoff interdependence, individual heterogeneity, jointnesss of supply, and the shape of the production function. The critical mass is the subgroup of actors in the larger group that will contribute enough resources to make it cost effective for other actors with less interest and less resources to see the benefits of their contributions. This resolves the efficacy problem and the free rider problem.</p>

<h3>Heckathorn, Douglas D. 1989. "Collective Action and the Second-Order Free-Rider Problem." <em>Rationality and Society</em> 1(1).</h3>

<p>Heckathorn's basic point is that selective incentives themselves constitutes a second-order free rider problem, since the selective incentive in itself is a collective good.</p>

<h3>Macy, Michael W. and A. Flache. 1995. "Beyond Rationality in Models of Choice." <em>ARS</em> 21.</h3>

<p>Macy and Flache provide a review of models of choice. They find two strands in this line of work: models that focus on network exchange and collective action, and models that rely on evolutionary theory. Models that rely on exchange focus on distribution of power in a network of social ties that limit opportunities for exchange. This attempts integrate the structural embeddedness of actors into choice-driven explanations of individual behavior and effects of network structure on outcomes. The literature on collective does not really focus on network exchange, instead focuses on free riding and efficacy. There is some possible overlap for these, e.g. Marwell and Oliver on selectivity by organizers, Gould on normative pressure as part of rational influence of vanguard contributors. The evolutionary models, however, are consequentialist -- outcomes are used to explain the actions that bring them about. Instead of focusing on marginal utility, they are backward looking -- "repetition, not intention, that brings the future to bear on the present." Stochastic learning is a version of this. Can also incorporate social conventions, institutionalized rituals, moral habits, and moral rules.</p>

<h3>Macy, Michael W. 1990. "Learning Theory and the Logic of Critical Mass." <em>ASR</em> 55(6).</h3>

<p>Macy attempts to extend the critical mass model by relaxing four strong constraints in the original formulation: rational actors; decisions as isolated events; deterministic outcomes; and pure jointness of supply. The key thing from this article is that actors can act based on a process of stochastic search, based on reinforcement and attenuation of cooperative propensities. In other words, actors act from what worked in the past. This extends the theory of critical mass in three ways: it reduces the cognitive demands on actors; it applies to behavior based on normative as well as instrument concerns; and applies to situations where rational actors may be trapped by strategic "gaming."</p>

<h3>Gould, Roger V. 1993. "Collective action and network structure." <em>ASR</em> 58(2).</h3>

<p>Gould develops a collective action model that is based on norms of fairness and the desire to avoid making contributions that will be wasted. This model depends strongly on the structural position of "volunteers" (those that will mobilize unconditionally): when they are centrally located, dense networks offer dimmer prospects for mobilization compared to sparser networks.</p>

<h3>Baldassarri, Delia. 2009. "Collective Action" in P. Hedstrom and P. Bearman (eds.) <em>The Oxford Handbook of Analytical Sociology</em>.</h3>

<p>Baldassarri wants to draw attention to the formation of group identity and the identification of the good. In using identity as a basis of action, it ignores the fact that collective identity may be a result of mobilization itself (Calhoun 1991; Gould 1995; Loveman 1998). It is also possible that actors will not gain from the attainment of the collective good, and would gain more from the pursuit of alternative goods. Need to incorporate these considerations into our models.</p>

<h3>Finkel, Steven E., Muller, Edward N., Opp, Karl-Dieter. 1989. "Personal Influence, Collective Rationality, and Mass Political Action." <em>APSR</em> 83(3).</h3>

<p>Finkel et al. want to connect the grievance model of collective action to RCT models. They relax some basic assumptions abut RCT models of collective action. They relax the assumption that people generally do not have the belief that their individual contribution will not matter much (the efficacy problem) and that they act on the basis of general strategic or ethical beliefs that promote collective rationality (free rider problem). Among three surveys of anti-nuclear activists in West Germany, they find that, given moderate-to-high levels of policy dissatisfactions and the more perceptions of likelihood of group success are coupled with either the belief in the unity or in a duty to participate, then the greater the likelihood that the individual will join a collective legal protest.</p>

<h3>Chong, Dennis. 1991. <em>Collective Action and the Civil Rights Movement</em>.</h3>

<p>Chong attempts to explain the Civil Rights Movement using a game theoretical framework. He considers a n-person assurance game, in which one needs universal cooperation for the good to be attained. He incorporates a discussion of solidary incentives which provide the incentives for individuals to participate. After a while, it is detrimental not to participate. However, this explanation is not great to explain the emergence of the CRM -- it is better to explain how this continued after it started. Incorporating aspects of the critical mass argument -- group heterogeneity in the form of leadership -- does more to explain this.</p>

<h2>Repression, countermovements and coevolution</h2>

<h3>Opp, Karl-Dieter and Roehl, Wolfgang. 1990. "Repression, Micromobilization, and Political Protest." <em>Social Forces</em> 69: 521-547.</h3>

<p>Opp and Roehl want to figure out what the actual effect of repression is, since different theories say different things about what it does. Repression always has a direct negative effect, but there are differing strengths for indirect effects of repression. Repression may affect three types of incentives to protest: social incentives (expectations of reference persons and informal positive and negative actions); moral incentives (protest norms and norms of violence); public goods incentives (system alienation and perceived influence by illegal and legal political action). An interaction of repression, illegitimacy of repression, and integration in protest-promoting groups, then, determines the effect of repression of protests.</p>

<h3>Koopmans, Ruud. 1993. "The dynamics of protest waves: West Germany, 1965 to 1989." <em>ASR</em> 58(5).</h3>

<p>Koopmans is attempting discover patterns of protest waves of new social movements in W. Germany. Groups seem to follow the pattern of more demonstrative protests early, more violent protests later. Institutionaliation and radicalization grow as professional SMOs and external allies get involved on one hand, and the state increases repression of confrontational actions on the other. Different wings respond to repression differently -- radicals as increasing and moderates as decreasing.</p>

<h3>Francisco, Ronald A. 2004. "After the Massacre: Mobilization in the Wake of Harsh Repression." <em>Mobilization</em>.</h3>

<p>Francisco wants to find out what happens after a massacre, if it promotes more protest (backlash mobilization) or protesters retreat. He finds that if there are deaths and injuries on the first two days of post-massacre backlash protests, there is probably less likely mobilization on day three.</p>

<h3>Loveman, Mara. 1998. "High-risk collective action: Defending Human Rights in Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina." <em>AJS</em> 104(2).</h3>

<p>Loveman attempts to understand when and under what conditions do high-risk social movements and their organizations emerge? She also attempts to understand why people would participate in such movements and organizations. She suggests that there is a strong causal contingency in this case. Individuals do not know the risks of this behavior a priori. She argues that collective interests, identities, and solidarity are conceived, constructed, maintained, and reproduced in the process of struggle itself. Social movements, resources (in terms of institutions), and political opportunity structures in terms of state repression matter for this mobilization.</p>

<h3>Hassanpour, Navid. 2011. "Media Disruption Exacerbates Revolutionary Unrest: Evidence from Mubarak's Natural Experiment." <em>APSA</em></h3>

<p>Hassanpour argues that media disruption in Egypt represented a "natural experiment." Repression in this case did not prevent protest from happening -- in this case it promoted it because of the types of decisions individuals would be making to protest on January 28, 2011.</p>

<h3>McAdam, Doug. 1983. "Tactical Innovation and the Pace of Insurgency." <em>ASR</em> 48: 735-754.</h3>

<p>McAdam wants to understand the dynamics of movement development and decline. He focuses on the interaction between tactical interaction and the pace of black insurgency between 1955-1970. The pace of insurgency depends on the use of creativity by insurgents in devising new tactical forms (tactical innovation) and the ability of opponents in neutralizing these moves through effective tactical counters (tactical adaptation). He finds that the move through different tactical forms generated new federal government action.</p>

<h3>Oliver, Pam and Daniel Myers. 2002. "The coevolution of social movements." <em>Mobilization</em> 8(1): 1-24.</h3>

<p>Oliver and Myers are attempting to provide a theoretical approach to organize existing understandings of social movements. Their two fundamental observations are that in movements, actions affect other actions, and mixes of different kinds of actions evolve over time, and that sets of actions coevolve with each other. Different mechanisms that are in operation -- stochastic probabilities, diffusion, adaptive learning, mutual adaption, and competition. </p>

<h3>Benjamin Lind and Judith Stepan-Norris. 2011. "The Relationality of Movements: Movement and Countermovement Resources, Infrastructure, and Leadership in the Los Angeles Tenants' Rights Mobilization, 1976-1979." <em>AJS</em> 116(5).</h3>

<p>Lind and Stepan-Norris focus on the resources, infrastructure, and leadership for a movement and its countermovement, the movement being the Los Angeles Tenants' Rights mobilization. They study how the relationality of each side, measured in network ties, organizational centrality. They find that the more that the countermovement has strong centrality, mobilization will be decreased.</p>

<h2>Collective identity</h2>

<h3>Calhoun, Craig. 1991. "The Problem of Identity in Collective Action." in <em>Macro-Micro Linkages in Sociology</em>.</h3>

<p>Calhoun attempts to argue against RCT and interest-based theories of collective action, insofar as identities cannot be reduced to interest, and, furthermore, identity can be forged in the act of collective action and in a social movement. He focuses on the Chinese democracy movement as an example of this, and attempts to articulate how the notion of honor further problematizes the individual as the starting point for analysis.</p>

<h3>Pfaff, S. 1996. "Collective Identity and Informal Groups in Revolutionary Mobilization: East Germany in 1989." <em>Social Forces</em> 75(1): 91-118.</h3>

<p>Pfaff mostly describes the development of collective identity in the East German revolution and how this collective identity served the basis of mobilization. He agrees with Calhoun that identities are formed in the process of mobilization. It is along these identities that loyalty and trust are generated. The reason that the revolution was surprising was that there is a deep contrast between public and private life in authoritarian societies. Germans connected idea of German nationalism with socialism and democracy.</p>

<h2>Right-wing movements</h2>

<h3>McVeigh, Rory. 2009. <em>The Rise of the Ku Klux Klan: Right-Wing Movements and National Politics</em>.</h3>

<p>McVeigh attempts to present a general model of right-wing mobilization by looking at 1920's KKK mobilization. He claims that existing models of social movements are inadequate because they were formulated with the idea of powerless movements in mind -- powerless movements that are resource-poor mobilize when they get resources, or when they have a political opportunity. He develops the "power-devaluation model" in response, which has three elements: power devaluation resulting from structural change; interpretive processes which lead to activation of organizational resources and exploitation of political opportunities. Power devaluation is when actors' (economic, political, and status-based) purchasing power within an exchange market are in decline because there are others (minorities) who offer the same things in exchange. </p>

<h3>Norris, Pippa. 2004. <em>The Rise of the Radical Right: Parties and electoral competition in postindustrial societies</em>.</h3>

<p>Norris attempts to explain the rise of right-wing parties in Europe. The puzzle is their rise in multicultural, "tolerate" societies. Her argument is effectively a political opportunity one. In the face of fragmentation of party systems, electoral volatility, and partisan dealignment, there is loosening voter loyalties for center parties. Radical right parties take advantage of this and structure their applies around cultural protectionism, attracting new party adherents.</p>

<h3>Skocpol, Theda and Vanessa Williamson. 2012. <em>The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism</em>.</h3>

<p>Skocpol and Williamson make some claims to the power devaluation model that McVeigh describes. Tea Party members are disenchanted conservatives (along with a few Democrats) with a strong ideology that promotes the deservingness of the participants with obvious racial undertones (echoes of Chad's argument here).</p>

<h3>Bakken, Geoff. 2012. On the Tea Party</h3>

<p>Geoff's argument is that one must consider the moral sensibilities of right-wing mobilization. They have a deep-seated moral commitment to a particular way of life which structures their view of the world, which had been upset with Obama's election.</p>

<h2>Networks and movements</h2>

<p>(skipping a lot of this because I'm fairly confident that I know a lot of what is said in this literature)</p>

<h3>Lim, Chaeyoon. 2008. "Social Networks and Political Participation: How Do Networks Matter?" <em>Social Forces</em> 87(2).</h3>

<p>Lim attempts to show that certain ties are better for mobilization than others. Many do not take into account the strength of the tie. So trying to find out which type of tie is better for mobilizing people and its strength. He finds that for acquaintances and close ties, individuals are more likely to contact their local officials and participate in community politics, however they do not participate in protest. He also finds that neighbors are able to get individuals involved with community politics, and those in common associations are able to recruit protest participants.</p>

<h2>Transnational movements</h2>

<h3>Keck, Margaret and Kathryn Sikkink. 1998. <em>Activists beyond borders: Advocacy networks in international politics</em>.</h3>

<p>Keck and Sikkink develop an idea of transnational advocacy networks. Transnational advocacy networks have proliferated as a result of communications technologies, activist legacy of the 1960s, and global spread of a normative discourse of human rights. Activists in different countries champion a cause, which makes it way onto a global stage. As these networks promote these causes, it promotes a "boomerang" effect in which other countries put pressure on the original country. They give empirical examples: babies killed by Nestle formula, anti-footbinding of women. </p>

<h3>Tarrow, Sidney. 1998. <em>Power in Movement</em> Ch. 11 - Transnational Contention</h3>

<p>Tarrow argues that there are potentially three hypotheses about transnational mobilization means. He suggests that (1) the world economy is rapidly globalizing along with its attendant system of communication; (2) changes open up enhanced possibilities for collective action; (3) they are knit together by international institutions and transnational social movements, something resembling a trnasnational civil society. But he also suggests that there has been transnational movements without new communication technologies. He posits a typology of transnational contention based on two dimensions -- integration into domestic social networks, and time frame. Movements with no integration in domestic networks and a temporary duration are a case of cross-border diffusion - communication of movement ideas, forms of organization, or challengers to similar targets from one center of contention to another. Integration in domestic social networks and temporary time frame makes transnational political exchange - temporary forms of cooperation among essentially national actors. Sustained and nonintegrated makes transnational advocacy networks, similar to what Keck and Sikkink think of. Lastly is sustained and integrated, transnational social movements - sustained contention interactions with opponents. He uses Greenpeace as an example.</p>

<h3>Ron, James. 1997. "Varying methods of state violence." <em>International Organization</em> 51(2).</h3>

<p>Ron wants to know why Israeli had changed its treatment of Palestinian prisoners. There had been no major changes within Israeli, so he turns to outside influences. He uses world polity theory and neo-institutionalism to understand how elements outside of Israel promoted the change. He suggests that, to be party of the world polity and to gain legitimacy within it, Israel must adopt the policies of human rights and refuse practices that are not in accordance with it. The Palestinian population is able to trigger world polity interest by promoting the idea of human rights, worked through organizations like the ICRC and B'Tselem to trigger world polity scrutiny. Good example of transnational advocacy networks.</p>

<h3>Rothman, Franklin Daniel and Pamela Oliver. 1999. "From local to global: the anti-dam movement in Southern Brazil, 1979-1992." <em>Mobilization</em> 4(1).</h3>

<p>Rothman and Oliver attempt to explain the emergence of the anti-dam movement in Brazil. They emphasize the local character of the anti-dam movement in its emergence, then talk about how it utilized nested political opportunity structures at the local, regional, national, and international level to further their cause. The movement had to shift its frame to comport with the frames of the more global ecology movement, but during this time those movements became more integrated.</p>

<h3>Bennett, W. Lance. 2003. "Communicating Global Activism: Some Strengths and Vulnerabilities of Networked Politics." In <em>Cyberprotest: New Media, Citizens and Social Movements</em>.</h3>

<p>Bennett is trying to place activist communication in transnational movements. Communication works as an activist strategy and organizational resource. Global activism is characterized by long-running communication campaigns to organize protest and publicize issues aimed at transnational organizations, corporations, and other bodies. Communication in diverse networks is ideologically thin. The Internet can affect the organization of global activist networks, and it can alter information flows through mass media.</p>

<h3>Garrido, Maria and Alexander Halavais. 2003. "Mapping Networks of Support for the Zapatista Movement: Applying Social-Networks Analysis to Study Contemporary Social Movements." Pp. 165-184 in <em>Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice</em></h3>

<p>Garrido and Halavais suggest that the Zapatista movement gained cross-national solidarity for their movement from different networks of activists across the world. They perform a social network analysis of the websites linking to the Zapatista site to understand the structure of these solidarities. </p>

<h3>Kay, Tamara. 2005. "Labor transnationalism and global governance: the impact of NAFTA on transnational labor relationships in North America." <em>AJS</em> 111:715-56.</h3>

<p>Kay argues that political process model has mostly been developed for national social movements and nation-states, but in fact we need to look at transnational political opportunity structures. We also need to articulate a theory of emergence of transnational labor movements in relation to global governance structures. She argues that three dimensions of POS at the transnational level explain how power is established: constitution of transnational actors and interests; definition and recognition of transnational rights; adjudication of rights at the transnational level. She argues that NAFTA catalyzed labor transnationalism in two ways: between 1989 and 1993, NAFTA stimulated unions to mobilize politically in order to prevent its passage; then after its passage in 1994, NAFTA had an institutional effect because it created new institutions through which labor activists could nurture transnational relationships.</p>

<h3>Evans, Peter. 2000. "Fighting Marginalization with Transnational Networks: Counter-Hegemonic Globalization." <em>Contemporary Sociology</em> 29(1).</h3>

<p>Evans suggests that transnationally organized political, economic, and cultural networks are emerging alongside the reorganization of global finance and production. Three types of transnational action: advocacy networks (Keck and Sikkink), transnational consumer/labor networks such as those targeted in anti-sweatshop campaigns, corporations rather than locals violators of global norms; and the labor movement, through attempting to spread core labor standards.</p>
